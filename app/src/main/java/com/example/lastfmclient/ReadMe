Possible Improvements:

1. Use Pagination library from Architecture Components to handle pagination
2. Separate layouts for phones and tablets - Master Detail Flow
3. More unit tests for other ViewModels and Instrumented tests for UI classes
4. Saving search queries to display search history during search
5. Animations - Shared Element Transitions for navigating activities and other subtle animations taking advantage of API 21+
6. Using parcels to transport model across activities
7. Implementing Local DataSource - using Room or other database solutions
8. Implementing In-Memory Cache in repository
